/**
 * Who has access to the admin panel, and at what level.
 *
 * <p>Three rules shape everything here, and each one closes a way the panel
 * could otherwise be lost or given away by accident:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>A grant creates no account and no password.</b> It means: when
 *       somebody signs in with that email, the panel appears. So access may
 *       only be granted to an email that already belongs to an account — an
 *       owner cannot hand the panel to an address nobody holds by mistyping
 *       it, and there is never a second credential to steal.
 *   <li><b>An admin cannot revoke their own access.</b> Not demote, not
 *       suspend, not remove. Every one of those would take away the permission
 *       needed to undo it.
 *   <li><b>The last active owner cannot be demoted or suspended.</b> Rule two
 *       stops an owner locking themselves out; without this one, two owners
 *       could still lock the company out by demoting each other in turn.
 * </ol>
