/**
 * Puts version one of the platform settings in place on an empty database.
 *
 * <p>Almost everything in this application reads the settings, and most of it
 * reads them through {@code currentReadOnly}, which refuses rather than seeding
 * — a read on a request path must not quietly write a row. So the seeding has
 * to happen once, at startup, before the first request arrives.
 *
 * <p>The defaults are the ones compiled into the Flutter client, so a fresh
 * deployment prices exactly as the app has always said it would: 17% a year on
 * savings, the published loan card, ₦5,000 flat management fee to ₦500,000.
 *
 * <p>Seeding never overwrites. Once a version exists this does nothing at all,
 * which is what makes it safe to run on every boot — including a boot that
 * follows an admin changing the rates five minutes earlier.
