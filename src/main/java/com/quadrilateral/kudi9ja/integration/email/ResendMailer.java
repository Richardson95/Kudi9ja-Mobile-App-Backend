/**
 * Email through Resend.
 *
 * <p>One POST against their REST API. There is no official Java SDK and none is
 * needed — the request is a JSON body and a bearer token, and a dependency that
 * wrapped it would be more code than it saved.
 *
 * <p>Sending is {@code @Async} and never throws. The three things this carries
 * are a one-time code, a security alert and a money confirmation, and each is
 * triggered by something that has <b>already happened</b> — an account was
 * opened, a payout account moved, a payment was confirmed. None of those should
 * fail because a mail provider is slow, so a failure here is logged and the
 * calling transaction is left alone.
 *
 * <p>That does mean a customer can be left waiting for a code that never
 * arrives, which is why the failure is logged at error rather than swallowed
 * quietly: it is an operational problem, not a customer mistake.
