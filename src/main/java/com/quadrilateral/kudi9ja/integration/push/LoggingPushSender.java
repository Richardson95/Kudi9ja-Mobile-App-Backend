/**
 * A push sender for local development and tests.
 *
 * <p>Records that a message would have gone out, to how many devices, and what
 * the lock screen would have said. It logs the body deliberately: unlike a
 * one-time code, a notification body is written to be read by the customer and
 * is already in the database, so there is nothing here a log file should not
 * hold.
 *
 * <p>Bound whenever no real provider is configured, so a deployment that has
 * not set up Firebase keeps working — customers simply read their notifications
 * when they open the app, which is exactly where the product was before push
 * existed.
