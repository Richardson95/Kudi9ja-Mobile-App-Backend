/**
 * How a notification reaches a phone that is not currently open.
 *
 * <p>An interface rather than a Firebase call, for the same reason the mailer
 * is one: the flows that notify a customer should not know what carries the
 * message, and a test should not need a Google project to run.
 *
 * <p>Delivery is <b>best effort and never blocking</b>. A notification is
 * already written to the database in the same transaction as the thing it
 * describes; push is a second, faster copy of it. If Firebase is slow or down,
 * the customer still has the notification the next time they open the app, and
 * the withdrawal that triggered it must not fail because a message could not be
 * delivered.
