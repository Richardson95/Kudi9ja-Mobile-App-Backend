/**
 * Approving money out.
 *
 * <p>By the time a request reaches this queue the wallet has <b>already been
 * debited</b> and a pending transaction is on the ledger. That happened at
 * request time so the same money could not be spent while an admin was looking
 * at it, and it changes what these two buttons mean:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Approve</b> settles the pending transaction. The money then leaves
 *       the collection account for the customer's own bank, which is a treasury
 *       action outside this system — recording the payout reference here is
 *       what ties the two together.
 *   <li><b>Decline</b> reverses the transaction and <b>refunds in full</b>. The
 *       ledger is append-only, so the row is not deleted: it becomes a reversal
 *       with a reason, and the customer can see what happened rather than
 *       finding a gap where their money was.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>There is no destination to choose and no way to change one. Money goes to
 * the payout account on the customer's own record, resolved and name-matched
 * when it was set — the Terms promise payouts only to an account in the
 * customer's own name, and an admin who could redirect one could break that.
