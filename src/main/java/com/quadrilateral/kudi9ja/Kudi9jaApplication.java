/**
 * The server behind the Kudi9ja mobile app.
 *
 * <p>Kudi9ja is a product of Quadrilateral Technologies Limited (RC 1657731),
 * Lagos, Nigeria. Every contract, receipt and legal document names the company,
 * not the product.
 *
 * <p>The client is not the source of truth. Balances, interest, credit scores
 * and loan pricing are all computed here; the client displays what it is given.
 *
 * <p>Scheduling is switched on by {@code SchedulingConfig} rather than here, so
 * that the property which disables the jobs actually disables them. Enabling it
 * in both places would leave the sweeps running whatever the configuration
 * said.
